### Bike Share Project
The python file used for this is called the Bike Share Project.

### Description
This project is about looking at data from a bike sharing program.  There are 3 cities of focus: New York City, Washington, and Chicago.  This is a program that takes user input and returns statistics about the bike share data.

### Files Used
This program uses 3 CSV files.  Each one is for a different city.  They are called chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv.

### Credits
Credit for this project goes to the Udacity Program, as they have provided all the documents and guidlines that I followed.
